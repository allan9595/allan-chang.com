<h2>
	Poem
</h2>
<p>
	There was a bright Shinning star, that led 3 wise man .

</p>

<p>
	To the birth of the king, who become a carpenter.
</p>

<p>
	A fisher of men and had 12 disciples , on a dark day , full of envy pain and death, he was crucified.


</p>

<p>
	He shed his precious blood, so we would become white as snows.
</p>

<p>
	He is now seated in Heaven, as the Father, son and Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
	He did all this because he loves you.
</p>
