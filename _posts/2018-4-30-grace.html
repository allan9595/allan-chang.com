<h2>
	Grace
</h2>
<p>
	I feel I haven’t write down something for a really long time. So, today I decided to come back write down something God really taught me over this half year. Yes, as you see, the topic I want to talk about is His Grace.
</p>
<p>
	For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God
</p>

<p>
	God’s Grace greater than my iniquity, yes, I often forget his Grace when I do sin or at spiritual low. Sometimes I would doubt my salvation in Christ when I sin against God. However, God’s grace and infinity love towards his children reminds me that by Grace I am saved through my faith.

<p>
	King David, a servant of God, had lusted, stole, fornicated, lied, and killed. He made some terrible decisions along the way. But, in Pslam, we see that how deep the love he has towards God. God always turn David’s iniquity to repentance, that means he turns away from sin. And God forgives. That’s grace! Like king David, We do make terrible decisions in our christian life too, but that not means God does not loves us or we are not saved anymore. His Mercy, his Grace, his blood on the cross are sufficient for our redemption.  We have to cry out for his Mercy and Grace. We have to rely on his Mercy and Grace not our own merit.
</p>

<p>
	Have mercy on me, O God,
    according to your unfailing love;
according to your great compassion
    blot out my transgressions.
Wash away all my iniquity
    and cleanse me from my sin.
</p>
<p>
	O Lord King Jesus, How Great you are remaining faithful on me even I am faithless on you. Praise you O gracious Lord. Your Will will be done on earth as is in Heaven.

	<p>
		if we are faithless,
    he remains faithful,
    for he cannot disown himself
