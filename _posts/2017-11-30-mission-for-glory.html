	Hi, friends, Allan is back. I haven’t updated my life for a while but I am still good either physically or spiritually. Last night, my pastor Zach preached a sermon “A mission for glory”, which I think it is something really awesome. My Lord Jesus will be the King of kings and Lord of lords and he will rule all the nations with his authority when he returns. If you are reading this passage, I really want to share the two facts that I wish you can know. First, quote from my favorite pastor Zach “God’s mission will be done anyway, it is our privilege to participate in the Great commission”. God is a sovereign God, everything is under his control. If you think God cannot finish his mission because of your choice, then you are wrong. Many men and women fulfill the great commission every day for the sake of Christ. Some of them even give up their life for Jesus, as it is written, “For your sake we are killed all the day long, because we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered”. The second fact I wish you could know is that in this Great commission, you can be a part of it either by holding the rope or go down the well. Wherever you go, whatever you do, do it for the glory of God. In two weeks, I will go to Asian  and share the gospel with some unreached souls. This is first international mission I have ever taken, I wish father will use me in a good way and finish his mission. Like my pastor Zach said, it is my privilege to go to Asian to help Father finish his mission and for his glory.

	Also, friends, life is short, but the better one is coming. Be thankful for everyday you had from Jesus. Lift his name high and share the gospel with your family and friends. Last night I shared the gospel with my mom. My mom always like to talk worldly things with me during the phone call. But last night I just have an great compassion on her. I do not want her leaving this world without Jesus. I do not want her going to a place never has lights. I want her being with Jesus and being in his glory and live with him in next thousand and thousand years. I told her what I believe is that I will have an eternal life after I die. My mind, my goal is set on the eternal life rather than worldly things. I told her the son of men came 2000 years ago died for us, for whoever believe in him will have eternal life. I truly wish my mom will have an eternal life in Jesus too. I know the life is so short we may die at anytime. Mom, I pray for Jesus would save you soul, I truly pray for you to open the bible and test if what I said is true or not.

	And friends, Allan wants to share a good tool I learned from Cole to study the bible. It is called HEAR. Highlights, Explain, Apply, and Respond. If you read specific passage in bible today, highlighting two verses of them and trying to use your own words to explain them. Then, thinking how these two verses can apply into your life and how you can respond it. I promise you, you will like this method. I love it!

	Last, friends, Allan loves you guys. I hope you all will have a good Christmas with family and enjoy this wonderful season from our savior Jesus.
