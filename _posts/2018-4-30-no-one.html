<h2>Unconditional Love</h2>
<p>
	No one is a good girl, yes, Angel, you are not a good girl, but I still love you. Ahh. I really love you bud. If you do not know who Angel is, she is my puppy, a cute Australia Shepherd. Three month ago, I got her from Denton Animal Shelter. In three month, God really used Angel taught me a lot of things. Mostly,  patience, love, compassion and grace. If you have owned a pet, I bet you understand what am I talking about.

	Angel is not a good girl. Sometimes, she blowed my trash can. Sometimes, she messes my room a little bit. But, just like my Heavenly Father loved me with Grace and Mercy, I forgive her every time when she doing wrong. Ahh, Yes, she is cute and I love her so much. Couple weeks ago, I read a article about how God concerned all creation includes animals. That means so should we.

	A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal.

	Love you Angel.  All Glory belongs to you Jesus. Even through Angel, You reveled your Glory. Praise you forever Lord King Jesus !
