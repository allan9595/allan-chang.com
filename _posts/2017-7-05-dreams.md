Law only effective while you alive.

Verse 4: You died and be able to marry to Christ.

Verse 5: When the Law, commandment , and the restrictions come upon a unbeliever, he or she will be rebellion it because our sinful nature in our flesh.

Verse 7-12

Verse 7: The law is not sin, isn’t bad. The Law is holy !

Verse 8: Men have rebellion heart, sinful nature. The root for what we are doing is because of our sinful nature. Not the Law.

Verse 13: The Law come to show us our sins.

Verse 14: Paul acknowledge that he still has the sinful flesh in his body and he struggled it everyday and fought with the sins everyday. Not only Paul, who dose not? Every Christian has sinful nature in their fleshes and we all are fight with our sins everyday !

Verse 15: Paul explains the struggles he has from his sins. He wants to obey Jesus.

Verse 16: Paul explains he is doing what he does not want to do is because his old flesh is doing them (Sin).

> “7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”[b]8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. 9 Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 10 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. 14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” -Romans 7:7-25
