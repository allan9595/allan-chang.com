I grow and raised in a atheist family back to china where mom and dad are not believers. Like most people back to home does, I don’t have any beliefs in the early year of my life. Mom and dad not believe any spiritual thing basically just live in a good life kind of mind like most people back to home. Until I went first year college in China, I had a chance to transfer to University of North Texas to finish the rest of my degree.

First time when I heard about God was through my host family and some other Chinese christian. But I was blinded at that time and not understanding anything. And a lot of things in christianity to me just not make any sense. I felt go to church and attend their events just something I could do to get into their heaven. In the end, I rejected this faith called “Christianity” and just wanna stay in my little bubble- atheists. I thought people believe God is crazy at that time. Lol, yes it is.

It was the time near the end of 2014, I met a friend in school who was a Mormon. He invited me to his church. I started beginning to like this church because people were so nice to me and everything looks like were so nice. And I began to practice this faith called Mormon and decide to invest my time in this church I thought was “good”. I thought I can get blessing from God by paying Tithing to the church. I thought I can eat bread and water every week to clean my sin. I thought I can earn more blessing from God by doing church calling. I thought I can get more blessing from God by reading Book Of Mormon everyday which i really did. But I did all of these things, I still not sure or know who this God I believed really is, who this Christ really is. And as a sinful man, I just can’t keep all the things and wisdom this church require me to do. I love everyone in the church but the struggling in my heart raised day by day.

In Dec 2015, I got a car wrecked on the freeway caused by sleeping. I was really scared and pushed my break hardly and the car just began to roll over on the ground eventually the car came back to the right position and allowed me jump out from the window.
It was at that moment I realize that Jesus couldn’t be more real because he saved me! And I thought it was sucks, my car wrecked totally. But at same time I survived and did not get really serious injures. I was pretty sure at that moment God is real and Jesus Christ saved my life. I thought that was a biggest miracle God did in my life to keep me alive. Praise Him. God made a joke to me, yep.

When I went back to Denton. I have no idea what I supposed to do. And shortly I went to Utah to visit my friend. We talked a lot about my experience in Mormon Church since he left Texas. I just wanna the freedom which belongs to myself. I did not wanna the blessing by paying the money. I did not wanna getting the blessing by avoid drink coffee and tea. I did not wanna follow a man made religion anymore. So after the trip from UTHA, I came back to DENTON and decided not go to Mormon Church anymore. After I stopped to go that church, my heart feels happy and freedom because I can focus more time in school and my work and do whatever I wanna to do. And I became a agnostic just feel I would never follow Jesus again and have a relationship with him again.

But God is sovereign and he has a great plan for me and he has already chosen me be his saints. I am crying now when I write this. I love Jesus ! In the end of the JUNE 2016, my motorcycle got wrecked again , yep, I feel God always do some bad things in my life in order to bring good . One day, when my Bike still in repair shop, one of my friend also co-worker gave me a ride back to home. On the way back to my house, I asked him “how do you think about Jesus Christ?” He told me ” Jesus Christ is my Lord, He is my savior ” . Really simple answer and powerful words. In the end, he invited me to his church (First Baptist Denton) and I fall in love with their message from Bible, which later on I knew it is the true gospel message – we are saved by God’s grace through faith which is nothing to do with our works. It was written in bible.

<blockquote>”For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast” -Eph 2:8-9.</blockquote>

When I heard our pastor Zach taught about how to get to heaven , which we never can by ourselves, only way is through JESUS CHRIST CAME DOWN TO THE EARTH DIED FOR YOU ON THE CROSS. Dang that’s right, praise Lord! This is what I exactly eagering for!

Upon that moment, God used HOLY SPIRIT fully opened my blind eyes and heart. I saw God’s love and immeasurable grace to me. Look back the way I came to know Jesus, it is kind long but it is perfect designed in God’s plan. The way go to heaven the ONLY way is through JESUS CHRIST. MY LORD MY LORD, I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH , THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE AND THE SALVATION TO THE HEAVEN YOU GAVE ME!

<blockquote>“I do not nullify the grace of GOD, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.”- GAL 2:21</blockquote>

If you are reading my testimony and have not yet believe, I pray for you and want to tell you, Jesus is real ! And Lord Jesus Christ is sovereign ! He will do good in your life through his sovereignty !


中文见证：

我出生并长大在一个无神论的家庭和国家。从小接受的教育是进化论和无神论。爸爸妈妈也不信主。像绝大多人一样，我认为只要有一个幸福的人生并且做一个好人这辈子我就满足了。可是，神就是那么的主权和奇妙，他总是喜欢和我开玩笑。

2014年，在国内念了一年的本科后，虽还未信住但所幸在神的计划下， 我踏上了飞机来带北德州大学完成我的大学学业。刚下飞机后， 自然而然美国家庭，当地和华人的弟兄姐妹自然很热心的给我传福音，邀请我去教堂。但是，我并不明白为什么。我感觉去教堂是一种累赘。好累的感觉，每周都要去诶。我也不知道福音到底意味着什么，感觉没有正真的理解福音。感觉好多关于耶稣基督的事情也想不通，不理解。 所以感觉去教堂就是为了别人而去。慢慢的，我也就逐渐的疏远了那一群兄弟姐妹还有我的美国家庭。感觉自己好盲诶，被撒旦的谎言所欺骗。

在入学半年后，感觉神又和我这个卑微的人开了玩笑。我认识了一个摩尔门教的同学，然后就和他去教会。如果你不知道什么是摩门教，其实就是美国本地的一个 “邪教”，具体上网搜一搜。一开始去摩门教感觉好好哦。摩门教的人对我都超好，传教士哥哥妹妹也都好帅好漂亮，还可以学英文。后来我就呆在了摩门教里并且热衷于这个宗教。可是，他们的好多规矩又让我的心好累，比如说不能喝咖啡喝茶因为他们说那得罪了上帝，可是这根本就没有在圣经里面提到。感觉呆在里面久了就是好多好多的事情要做，与此同时，我还是不认识这位真正的神，真正的主耶稣。感觉被这些所谓的摩门教律法压的好累。正如主耶稣所说 “ 

<blockquote>耶 稣 说 ： 你 们 律 法 师 也 有 祸 了 ！ 因 为 你 们 把 难 担 的 担 子 放 在 人 身 上 ， 自 己 一 个 指 头 却 不 肯 动 。”路加福音：11:46</blockquote>

15年年底，再加入摩尔门教一年后，神又和我开了个玩笑。这回感觉是他真的想让我认识他。我开车睡着了哦。车在高速上滚了几转。但神奇的是，我十分淡定的从压瘪了的车窗里走了出来，毫发无损，只是擦破了一点皮。我感觉很沮丧但在那时，我觉得是这位天地万物的主耶稣救了我诶。没有他我早挂了。自那以后，我就知道世上肯定有神的。

后来，一个月后， 我回到了我所在的登顿城，辞退了摩门教，这时的我，内心其实很复杂，被摩门教伤透了心的我，不想和任何宗教有往来，也不想和神有往来。就想好好学习，天天向上！

半年后，一个傍晚准备回家的时候，我的美国朋友很主动乐意的送我回家，因为我把车给毁了。半路上，不知怎的，就开始问他关于圣经和耶稣的问题。感觉全能的主，万物的神，主权的主在这个时候发挥他主权的能力，开始在我心中做工了。到家后，他邀请我那周天去他的教会，这个是当地很好的一个教会叫第一浸信会教堂。我很愉快的接受了他的邀请，虽然内心有一点犹豫要不要去，但是想想为何不试试呢。果真这位神知道了我的内心也在我的想法上做工。

那天周天，到了教堂，牧师高兴的欢迎了我，是一个很帅的叫 Austin 的牧师。主日学上，我第一次听说因信称义和耶稣来到这个世上救你，你永远不可能救自己。只要信了耶稣接可以去天堂。yo, 感觉这道听起来好犀利的感觉，顿时感觉这个福音是我盼来已久的真福音，因信称义。后来，在门徒训练的过程中，我的好友小 austin 和 cole 又进一步的解释了因信称义。 我立马就决定，这位主，我信了。既然神的恩典已经来到我面前，为什么不接受他呢？ 后来的后来，我就信了，凭着主唯一的宝血，我就这样注定有了永生，去了天堂！那一刻，感觉内心好开心，好自由，只要信了就可以去天堂。再也不是自己做好事去天堂的假福音了。

<blockquote>“你 们 得 救 是 本 乎 恩 ， 也 因 着 信 ； 这 并 不 是 出 於 自 己 ， 乃 是 神 所 赐 的 ； 也 不 是 出 於 行 为 ， 免 得 有 人 自 夸 。” 以弗所书 ： 2：8-9</blockquote>

感觉信住的过程，一路坎坷，但是我想说，神的主权永远是神的主权，如果神这一生拣选了你，那么你将必属于他也必信他！赞美主让我到他跟前来认罪，忏悔得永生。如果你在读我的见证但却还未信主，我为你祷告，求神打开你的心志去信他。因为，这真正而美好的福音是耶稣来到这个世上为你得罪而死，你唯一所需做的就是接受他免费的礼物和恩典然后追随他，认识他！你就会得永生。永远都不关于你去了多少次教会，做了多少好事，因为你的好事和耶稣的死比起来一文不值！

求主给你平安，也让你看到他的恩典。

爱你！
