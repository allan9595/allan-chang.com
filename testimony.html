<p>I am ALLAN CHANG. A sinner saved by God’s Grace AT June ,2016. In Aug 2014, I chose to come to Texas to study and experience life.  Honestly, I did not expect too much and just want to see what was looks like in another side of the world.</p>

<p>First time when I heard about God was through my host family. But I was so blind at that time and not understanding why God loved me so much. And a lot of things to me just not make sense. I thought they love me was because they want to share gospel to me and invite me to their church. In the end, I rejected this faith called “Christianity” and just wanna stay in my little bubble- atheists. I thought people believe God is crazy at that time. Lol, yes it is.

</p>

<p >It was the time near the end of 2014, I met a friend in school who from TaiWan. We became really good friend. When we were friend, he told me he went to Mormon Church (LDS) and invited me to his church. I started beginning to like this church because people were so nice to me and everything looks like were so nice. And I began to practice this faith called Mormon and decide to invest my time in this church I thought was “good”. I thought I can get blessing from God by paying Tithing to the church. I thought I can eat bread and water every week to clean my sin. I thought I can earn more blessing from God by doing church calling. I thought I can get more blessing from God by reading Book Of Mormon everyday which i really did. But I did all of these things, I still not sure or know who this God I believed really is, who this Christ really is. And as a sinful man, I just can’t keep all the things and wisdom this church require me to do. I love everyone in the church but the struggling in my heart raised day by day.</p>

<p>In Dec 2015, I drove my car to New Mexico . And I fall asleep on the half way since it was kind hot. And when I woke up, My car has already off the road and the speed is nearly 80 mph. I was really scared and pushed my break hardly and the car just began to roll over on the ground for three times eventually the car came back to the right position and allowed me jump out from the window.
</p>

<p>It was at that moment I heard a voice in my heart ” ALLAN, here I AM WITH YOU !” And I thought it was sucks, my car wrecked totally. But at same time I survived and did not get really serious injures. I was pretty sure at that moment God is real and Jesus Christ saved my life.</p>

<p>
When I went back to Denton. I have no idea what I supposed to do. And shortly I went to Utah to visit my TAI WAN friend. We talked a lot about my experience in Mormon Church since he left Texas. I just wanna the freedom which belongs to myself. I did not wanna the blessing by paying the money. I did not wanna getting the blessing by avoid drink coffee and tea. I did not wanna follow a man (Joseph Smith) I even did not know if he lied or not, which now I know he did. So after the trip from UTHA, I came back to DENTON and decided not go to Mormon Church anymore. After I stopped to go that church, my heart feels happy and freedom because I can focus more time in school and my work and do whatever I wanna to do. And I became a agnostic just feel I would never follow Jesus again and have a relationship with him again………….

	But surely God has a great plan for me and he has already chosen me be his saints. Tear up…….. I love Jesus ! In the end of the JUNE 2016, my motorcycle  got wrecked again ( I got a motorcycle after i lost my car). One day, when my Bike still in repair shop, one of my friend also co-worker Armias gave me a ride back to home. On the way back to my house, I asked Armias “how do you think about Jesus Christ?” He told me ” Jesus Christ is my Lord, He is my savior ” . Really simple answer and powerful words. In the end, Armias invited me to his church (First Baptist Denton) and I fall in love with their message from Bible, which later on I knew it is the true gospel message – we are saved by God’s grace through faith which is nothing to do with our works. It was written in bible
</p>
<blockquote>
	”For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not  your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast” -Eph 2:8-9.

	When I heard our pastor Zach taught about how to get to heaven , which we never can by ourselves, only way is through JESUS CHRIST CAME DOWN TO THE EARTH DIED FOR YOU ON THE CROSS. I was shocked and had never heard about that part before.
</p>
<p>
	Upon that moment, God used HOLY SPIRIT fully opened my blind eyes and heart. I saw God’s love and immeasurable grace to me. Look back the way I came to know Jesus, it is kind long but it is perfect designed in God’s plan. The way go to heaven the ONLY way is through JESUS CHRIST.  MY LORD MY LORD, I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH , THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE AND THE SALVATION TO THE HEAVEN YOU GAVE ME! TEAR UP ……….</p>
